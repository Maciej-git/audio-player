# Audio Player
Audio Player Mini-Project build during "Embedded Systems Essentials with Arm: Get Practical with Hardware" course by Arm Education.

The project aims to design and build a simple audio player, with user control: selects and plays one of 8 tunes, with name displayed on LCD.

Main functionality:
- Play 8 different songs selected by three push buttons,
- Display on LCD the name of the song that is being played,
- Show the status using LEDs,
- Display instructions for use,
- Adjust the volume of the song,
- Replicate and extend communication with user, through PC screen,
- Scroll the song names and numbers across the LCD while in "Ready" state, giving the user information about available songs.
